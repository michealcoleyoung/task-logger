This script is a time tracker that allows the user to record what they are working on and the amount of time they spend on each task. The user is prompted to input the task they are working on, and the script records the start time and date. Once the user completes the task, they can stop the timer and the script records the end time and calculates the total time worked. The user can then export the data in a formatted string or copy it to the clipboard.

The script uses the following third-party modules:

- pyperclip for copying data to the clipboard
- datetime for calculating the total time worked

To use the script, the user should open the file in a Python environment and run the script. They will be prompted to enter the task they are working on. To stop the timer and record the time worked, they need to press the 'Enter' key. To export the data, the user can enter 'export data' as the task. The data will be formatted and printed to the console, and also copied to the clipboard for easy pasting.

Note: The script assumes that the local time zone is in Central Standard Time (CST), and may need to be modified if used in a different time zone.
